I've built bakari.tech using Next.js 14, implementing server-side rendering and a story-driven navigation system that guide users through my history. I leverage Framer Motion for performant animations, optimized image delivery, and comprehensive SEO implementationâ€”demonstrating the kind of scalable frontend architecture I bring to production systems. This portfolio showcases both my technical depth across full-stack development and my approach to building user-centric products that balance engineering excellence with thoughtful design. I invite you to explore the live implementation at https://bakari.tech and experience how I translate technical vision into a compelling digital experience.
